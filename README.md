# Arduino-Basic-Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot
Object Deflection Device Using Embedded C

# Why?
Object Deflection device : It simply avoid the objects infront of it and if the objects comes infront of it then it changes direction accordingly

# How-To
Just load the embedded language and execute it 

The system provides direction to the device. If any obstacle comes on its way, it changes its direction itself. Language used is C, and Open CV is the Library used. Built this Interface of Arduino using Arduino C Programming. Connection of all the components with the arduino and programmed them according to their Working.
Components Used: HCSR04 Ultrasonic Sensors, LM298N Motor Driver Module, Arduino Uno.
